excerpt: 'The study highlights that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), particularly anodal-tDCS, enhances baseline activity and sharpens spatial tuning in the early visual cortex (EVC) by augmenting surround suppression. These effects are hypothesized to involve upregulation of GABAergic neurons, which increases synaptic inhibition and metabolic energy consumption. This suggests that GABAergic modulation plays a critical role in the circuit-level effects of tDCS on EVC'
