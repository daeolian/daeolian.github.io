excerpt: 'This study utilized a Free Association Semantic Task (FAST) and Word2Vec-based natural language processing to explore the connection between spontaneous thoughts and happiness. Happier individuals demonstrated stronger semantic associations with “friend,” prioritizing social relationships over monetary gains in decision-making scenarios. These findings emphasize the cognitive representation of social connections as a critical factor in subjective well-being.'
