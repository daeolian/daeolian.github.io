excerpt: 'Pupillometry is a popular tool for studying cognitive and neural processes, but eye blinking can confound measurements by inducing blink-locked pupillary responses (BPR). This study characterized BPR properties, demonstrated their cognitive dependency, and developed a probabilistic algorithm to de-confound pupillary data. The algorithm improves measurement validity and enhances the statistical power of pupillometry experiments.'
