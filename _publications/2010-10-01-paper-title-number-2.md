excerpt: 'This study proposed a method to improve multichannel transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) focality by averaging injection current patterns optimized across multiple head models. Results showed that using a mean current pattern from at least 13 head models significantly enhanced stimulation focality compared to a single standard model. This approach offers a practical solution when individual MRIs are unavailable.'
